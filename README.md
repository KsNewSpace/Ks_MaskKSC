# Parallax_MaskKSC
Simple mod to mask out the Kerbal Space Center from Parallax scatters using a custom black and white mask.

# Installation (hacky)

Backup and replace following files with the ones provided

Kerbal Space Program\GameData\Parallax_StockTerrainTextures\_Configs\StockPlanetAdjustments.cfg
Kerbal Space Program\GameData\Parallax_StockScatterTextures\Textures\Kerbin\PluginData\kscMask.dds

You can also replace the "MapDecalVertexRemoveScatter" section. That's all we need here. Just in case the rest of the file is different for you.
